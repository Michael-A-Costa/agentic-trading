An agentic trading workspace — research, backtest, and (carefully) execute equity trades
through the Robinhood trading MCP, driven by Claude Code.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in risk limits / knobs
```

The Robinhood MCP is registered in `.mcp.json`. Connect/authenticate it from Claude Code
with `/mcp` (`robinhood-trading`). The engine also reads that same authenticated session
**directly** (no LLM) for fast, deterministic broker reads — see `scripts/rh_direct.py`.

## How it runs

Two scheduled loops per mode (launchd), selected by **which entry script runs** — there is no
mode flag to flip by accident:

- **Paper** (default, simulated fills): `run_paper_tick.sh` every 15 min + `run_paper_sentinel.sh`
  every 1 min. Flow: market regime → `tick_context.py` (screen + gate) → `decide.py` (deep DD) →
  `apply_decision.py` (simulated fill).
- **Live** (real orders): `run_live_tick.sh` every 5 min + `run_live_sentinel.sh` every 1 min.
  Flow: precheck → `broker_snapshot.py` → `live_tick_context.py` → `decide.py` → `live_execute.py`
  (`review → place` via the MCP). **Live is double-gated:** it only places when `LIVE_ARMED=1`;
  otherwise it dry-runs (real review, places nothing).

The book is split two ways (`strategies/two-book-v2-plan.md`): **pead** — a measured mega-cap
post-earnings drift sleeve that lets winners run — and **disco** — discretionary catalyst names
the agent picks with free rein. Downside protection (catastrophe stop, soft-cut, breakeven rung)
is **global** to both; profit-harvest is **per-book** (disco runs a tighter take-profit + remnant
trail via the `DISCO_*` knobs, pead keeps the globals). Every fill — paper or live — is journaled
by `trade_log.py`; read it back with `scripts/trade_ledger.py` (round-trips) and
`scripts/pnl_report.py` (realized P&L + exit-type breakdown).

## Safety

Real money runs through this repo. Read **CLAUDE.md → Critical Rules** first. The operating
model is **autonomous, not per-trade approval** — the seatbelt is code, not a human clicking "yes":

- **Autonomous within one account.** Trades run unattended in the isolated, agentic-allowed
  account with **no per-trade human sign-off**. Every other account is read-only.
- **Safety lives in code**, enforced deterministically: the `.env` caps (`MAX_POSITION_PCT`,
  `MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_PCT`, `MAX_PER_TRADE_LOSS_PCT`, `STOP_LOSS_PCT`, `MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS`),
  per-position stops/take-profits, a daily-loss **circuit breaker** (`DAILY_MAX_LOSS_PCT`), a
  cash-account settled-funds guard, and append-only logging of every decision + fill to `data/`.
- `review_equity_order` precedes `place_equity_order` to catch **broker alerts** (PDT, halts,
  buying power) and to log the preview — it is **not** a human approval gate.
- **Kill switches** (in order of preference): `launchctl unload` the live plist; set `LIVE_ARMED=0`
  (arms nothing, dry-run only); or disconnect the `robinhood-trading` MCP.
- Secrets and real account data never get committed (`.env` and `data/` are gitignored).
